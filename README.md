This selenium python script allows you to get various prices of a stock ticker for the current day (or last market day). It assumes that you input a valid ticker in the command prompt, but has guards for input length. To run the script, you will have to first download Selenium and add it to your environment PATH. As with any web-scraping tool, it is likely that at some point the layout of the site used will change and the XPATH's hard-coded into this script will no longer be valid.
